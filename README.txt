ðŸ”„ Euler Circle Finder in C++
A comprehensive C++ implementation that determines the existence of an Euler circle in both directed and undirected graphs.

ðŸ“– Description
This project contains a robust C++ class for handling both directed and undirected graphs. Additionally, the algorithm for detecting an Euler circle given a graph is meticulously implemented, allowing users to quickly determine the presence (or lack) of such circles.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Input
Is the graph directed?:
y for a directed graph
n for an undirected graph
Number of Vertices: An integer n representing the number of vertices in the graph.
Number of Arcs: An integer m denoting the number of arcs/edges in the graph.
Arcs Description: A series of pairs from the set {n1, n2, ...} representing the arcs/edges of the graph.
Output
The program will either:

Display the Euler circle with its constituent vertices.
State that there is no Euler circle present in the graph.

ðŸŽˆ Usage
$ ./euler_circle_finder
Is the graph directed: y/n
> y
> 4
> 4
> 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1
