In this project there is an implementation in the c++ language of the algorithm for finding an Euler circle in a graph.
In the project I built a class for directed and undirected graphs, and also implemented the algorithm for finding an Euler circle given a graph.

main function of the program:
"Is the graph directed: y/n": print 1
2. You will receive the following input:
2.1 the letter y (directed graph) or n (undirected graph)
2.2 An integer, n, that marks the number of vertices in the graph.
2.3 An integer, m, which marks the number of arcs in the graph.
2.4 A series of pairs of numbers from the group {n1,2,..., {that represent the arcs of the graph.

The output: Is there an Euler circle and the vertices of disgust, if the circle does not exist the program will print that there is no Euler circle in the graph
